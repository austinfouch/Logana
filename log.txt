	- Implemented the Tile class. Created a copy constructor Tile::Tile(const int&, const int&) and a void Tile::swap_pips() function that swaps the values of the leftPips and rightPips of a tile. (20 min)
	- Implemented the Hand class. Created a copy constructor Hand::Hand(const vector<Tile> &t) and a void Hand::push_back(const Tile&) function that gives member data access to Hand.tiles.push_back(tile). (10 min)
	- Partially implemented the Board class. Created the functions void Board::push_left(const Tile&) and void Board::push_right(const Tile&) to give push_back() functionality to Board member stacks, stack<Tile> leftSide and stack<Tile> rightSide. (30 min)
	- Partially implemented the Player class. Created the functions void Player::push_back(const Tile &t) which calls the Player's hand function, void Hand::push_back(t). (10 min)

	- Implemented a vector<Tile> Round::create_tiles() function which returns a vector<Tile> of all the tiles in a 6-6 set, first element being a 6-6 tile and the last being a 0-0 tile. This was done by defining MAX_PIP_SIZE and MIN_PIP_SIZE and for-loops. (1 hour)
	- Implemented a void Round::distribute_tiles(vector<Tile> &tileList) function that calls std::random_shuffle() on the input vector and uses NUM_PLAYERS and MAX_HAND_SIZE in order to distribute the shuffled vector to a player's hand. Initally used a deque<Tile> instead of vector<Tile> becuase I thought a vector elements could nto be accessed with a back() or front() function. (45 min)

	- Implemented the Boneyard class which acts as a stack<Tile>. It contains functions Tile Boneyard::pop(), void Boneyard::push(const Tile &t), bool Boneyard::empty() and Tile& Boneyard::top() in order to give complete access to Boneyard.tiles member variable of type stack<Tile>. (30 min)
	- Implemented further functionality for the void Round::distribute_tiles(vector<Tile> &tileList) to not only distribute the inital vector<Tile> tileList created by void Round::create_tiles() to the player's hands but also the boneyard. (30 min)
